# TFRecommendersExampleRetailData
Tensorflow Recommenders (TFRS) with example on retail dataset, written in Python language.

E-commerce dataset was provided by Olist, a Brazilian E-Commerce platform, available in Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce

TFRS full guide is here: https://www.tensorflow.org/recommenders

Tensorflow installation is here: https://www.tensorflow.org/install

Tensorflow 2 only runs on most latest version of Python. I strongly recommend users to install TF and TFRS in a conda environment. Here is an example:

conda create --name tensorflow2 python=3.8 ipykernel

python -m ipykernel install --user --name tensorflow2 --display-name "Python (tensorflow 2.0)"

pip install tensorflow

conda install pandas matplotlib seaborn
